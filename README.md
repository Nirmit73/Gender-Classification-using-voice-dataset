# ML Projects
1) The Gender Classification file consists of EDA of voice dataset downloaded from kaggle. 

   Following 4 ML algorithms are used:
   (i) Kernel SVM
  (ii) Random Forest
 (iii) Decision Tree
  (iv) XgBoost
 
 Comparative analysis is performed after applying feature selection, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter optimization and the best algorithm is determined based on   accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.

2) Possum Regression file-Exploratory Data Analysis of Possum dataset (from kaggle).
   
   Following ML algorithms are used:
   (i) Linear Regression
  (ii) Support Vector Regressor
  
  At the end, results are compared on the basis of different evaluation metrics.
