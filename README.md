# ML Projects
  ## The Gender Classification using voice dataset. 
  
  Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is performed on the voice dataset which was downloaded from kaggle.

   Following 4 ML algorithms are used for classification task:
   
   (i) Kernel SVM
   
   (ii) Random Forest
  
   (iii) Decision Tree
 
   (iv) XgBoost
 
    Comparative analysis is performed after applying feature selection, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter optimization and the best algorithm is determined based     on accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
    

  ## Possum Regression
  
  EDA is performed on the possum dataset available on kaggle.
   
   Following ML algorithms are used for the regression task:
   
   (i) Linear Regression
   
   (ii) Support Vector Regressor
   
    At the end, results are compared on the basis of different evaluation metrics.
